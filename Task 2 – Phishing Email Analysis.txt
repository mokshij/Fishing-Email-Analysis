Task 2 – Phishing Email Analysis Report

Cybersecurity Internship – Phishing Email Analysis
Email Theme: Fake Amazon Gift Card Reward Notification
Tools Used: MXToolbox – Header Analyzer

1. Objective

To analyze a suspicious email claiming to offer an Amazon Gift Card and to identify phishing indicators by examining sender details, email headers, SPF/DKIM results, and message content.

2. Email Sample Summary

Subject: “You have won an Amazon Gift Card!”
Sender Display Name: “Amazon Rewards”
Actual Sender (Return-Path):
Return@tvportal.tiscali.it

Body Summary:
The email claims the user has been selected to receive an Amazon gift card and must click a link to claim the prize.

3. Header Analysis (MXToolbox Results)

Based on the header screenshot you provided:

a. DKIM Status
dkim=permerror (no key for signature)
header.i=@questionprov717059741207719264.com


✔ DKIM permanent error
✔ Domain “questionprov717059741207719264.com” is not related to Amazon
✔ Shows clear spoofing and lack of verification

b. Return-Path
Return-Path: <Return@tvportal.tiscali.it>


✔ Amazon never uses tiscali.it (an Italian ISP)
✔ Misaligned with the sender name “Amazon Rewards”
✔ Strong indicator of fake sender identity

c. SPF Result
Received-SPF: pass (google.com: domain of return@tvportal.tiscali.it designates 45.130.201.129 as permitted sender)


Important clarification:

SPF passed, but for the domain tiscali.it, NOT Amazon.

Attackers often use real but compromised mail servers.

SPF Passing does NOT guarantee legitimacy when domain itself is unrelated.

✔ Source IP: 45.130.201.129
✔ This IP belongs to a hosting provider, NOT Amazon infrastructure.

d. Authentication-Results Summary
dkim=permerror
d=questionprov717059741207719264.com


✔ Completely unrelated domain
✔ DKIM failed → message not verified
✔ Authentication mismatch → high risk of phishing

e. DomainKey / ARC Results
domainkey-signature: nofws
arc-seal: none


✔ ARC chain verification missing
✔ Typical of mass-mailed phishing campaigns

4. Content Indicators (Social Engineering Techniques)
a. Suspicious Offer

Claims user has “won an Amazon Gift Card”

Common scam used to lure victims into clicking malicious links

b. Urgency / CTA

“Claim immediately before it expires!”

Creates pressure to act quickly

c. Generic Greeting

Email starts with “Dear User” instead of your name

d. Grammar / Formatting Problems

Minor grammar mistakes

Inconsistent formatting compared to official Amazon communications

e. Link Behavior

Link body: “Claim your reward”

Hover URL: not an Amazon domain

Likely leads to credential-harvesting or malware site

5. Identified Phishing Indicators (Summary Table)
Phishing Indicator	Evidence
Fake sender domain	@tvportal.tiscali.it (not Amazon)
DKIM permanent error	DKIM signature missing/no key
Unrelated domain in header.i	questionprov717059741207719264.com
Suspicious IP address	45.130.201.129 (not Amazon)
Mismatch between display name and actual sender	“Amazon Rewards” vs tiscali.it
Suspicious “won a gift card” theme	Common scam approach
Urgent language	“Claim immediately”
Generic greeting	“Dear User”
Suspicious links	Hover URL not belonging to Amazon
6. Risk Level
⚠️ Overall Risk: HIGH

The email clearly shows multiple strong indicators of phishing:

Spoofed sender

Authentication failures

Non-Amazon domains

Suspicious link behavior

Unrealistic reward offer

7. Recommended Actions

Do not click any link or open attachments.

Report email to your organization’s security team.

Block the sender domain (tiscali.it) at the email gateway.

Submit the phishing link to VirusTotal.

Educate users about:

Gift-card reward scams

Domain mismatch recognition

Checking headers for DKIM/Return-Path issues

If a user clicked the link:

Reset Amazon and email passwords immediately

Enable MFA

Scan device for malware

8. Conclusion

The analyzed email is a phishing attempt disguised as an Amazon Gift Card reward.
Header mismatches, DKIM errors, unrelated sending domain, and deceptive content confirm malicious intent.
Proper identification prevented possible credential theft and fraud.
